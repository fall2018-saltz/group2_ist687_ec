This way flyers can analyze which airport to avoid if they have more than one airport in their vicinity, meaning if a passenger lives in NYC he/she has option to travel from JFK, EWR, or LaGuardia. By finding maximum delay time among these airport one can choose the better airport to travel from. \r\n",
